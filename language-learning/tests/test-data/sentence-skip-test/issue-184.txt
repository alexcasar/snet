CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole

Oh dear !

In another moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

How brave they'll all think me at home !

Why , I wouldn't say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house ! '

( Which was very likely true. )

Down , down , down.

Would the fall NEVER come to an end !

' I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time ? ' she said aloud.

' I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.

( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say. )

Presently she began again.

' I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth !

How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward !

Do you think you could manage it ? )

' And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking !

No , it'll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere. '

Down , down , down.
