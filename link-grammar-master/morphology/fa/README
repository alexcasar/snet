            PersianLG operating instructions
            --------------------------------

The link-grammar parser is meant to be used together with the stemmer in
this directory.  Using this is as simple as saying:

   echo -e "my sentence\n" | ./stemmer.pl -u | link-parser fa

The above is wrapped up in a very short shell script called persianparse.sh
To use this script, just say:

   ./persianparse.sh 'my sentence'

Most of the scripts included under the 'scripts' directory can be run by
typing (in this directory) './myscript.pl < myinput.txt > myoutput.txt'

For more information about the Persian link-grammar, see the README file
in the /data/fa directory.
