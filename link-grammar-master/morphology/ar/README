                  Morphology tools for Arabic
                  ---------------------------

The Link Grammar Arabic dictionaries require that the input has
been previously stemmed with the aramorph-1.2.1 Arabic stemming
package.  Aramorph is available at 

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/aramorph/

as well as at other locations.

The shell script ./arabiclg_one_sentence.sh can be used as

   ./arabiclg_one_sentence.sh "input test sentence"

It then invokes the morphology analyzer, then a small perl script
to clean up the output, and then passes the whole thing to the 
arabic link-grammar parser.

Examples of pre-analyzed sentences can be found in /data/ar/4.0.batch
